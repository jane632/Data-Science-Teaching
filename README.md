# Student Performance Classification

This project uses a dataset of 1,000 students to predict whether a student passes or fails based on their average score in math, reading, and writing. The model is built using logistic regression and evaluated with common classification metrics.

## Project Structure

- `Student Performance.ipynb`: Main notebook with code for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation
- `StudentsPerformance.csv`: Source dataset with student performance and demographic info

## üìä Dataset Overview

The dataset includes:
- **Numerical columns**: `math score`, `reading score`, `writing score`
- **Categorical columns**: `gender`, `race/ethnicity`, `parental level of education`, `lunch`, `test preparation course`

A new binary target variable, `pass/fail`, is engineered based on the average score across the three subjects.

##  Methods Used

- **Data Cleaning**: Checking for nulls and formatting issues
- **Feature Engineering**: 
  - Calculating average score
  - Creating a binary target (`Pass` if average score ‚â• threshold, else `Fail`)
- **Preprocessing**: 
  - One-hot encoding for categorical variables
  - Feature scaling for numerical columns
- **Modeling**: 
  - Logistic Regression
- **Evaluation**: 
  - Accuracy Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - F1 Score
  - Cross-Validation

##  Results

- The logistic regression model achieved a solid balance between accuracy and F1 score, demonstrating that basic preprocessing and a simple model can be effective with the right feature engineering.
- Cross-validation was used to help ensure the model generalizes well.

##  How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook and dataset.
2. Make sure the following libraries are installed:
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn



#  SQL Data Exploration Project

##  Overview

This project showcases the use of **SQL for data exploration and business analysis**. It contains a series of structured SQL queries that address real-world data problems by extracting insights, performing aggregations, and transforming relational data.

#  Section 5 Bonus ‚Äì Learning Reflection as a Junior Data Scientist

 It focuses on strategies for supporting peers who may be struggling with deadlines or difficult concepts, especially in fast-paced learning environments.

##  Summary

The reflection draws from my own experience in a high-intensity data science bootcamp, where I had to quickly absorb new skills and complete a full project in under a month. I shared:

- **Study Techniques**: I leaned on the Feynman Technique to break down and internalize complex topics.
- **External Resources**: Platforms like Krish Naik's YouTube channel played a major role in helping me reinforce difficult concepts.
- **Mindset**: I emphasized the importance of normalizing struggle and creating a safe, supportive learning space.
- **Consistency**: I recommended building routines like daily review and reflection to increase retention and clarity.

##  Takeaways

This reflection isn't just a look back‚Äîit's also a guide for how I‚Äôd approach mentoring or team collaboration as a junior data scientist. It's about:

- Empathy for others in learning environments
- Clear communication of complex ideas
- Lifelong learning habits



#   Prompt Engineering for AI-Assisted Data Analysis

This document explores how prompt engineering can be used to guide large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in performing tasks related to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Rather than conducting the EDA directly, the focus is on crafting effective prompts to instruct AI to generate insights, visualizations, and summaries based on student performance data.

##   What This Is

As a junior data scientist, learning how to **leverage AI tools like ChatGPT** is becoming just as important as mastering traditional Python libraries. This guide demonstrates how to:

- Frame prompts that elicit helpful, accurate analysis from ChatGPT
- Use LLMs to identify trends, suggest visualizations, or summarize statistical relationships
- Collaborate with AI to accelerate the EDA process, especially in educational datasets

##  Key Topics Covered

- Writing clear and specific prompts for different stages of data analysis
- Using ChatGPT to ask follow-up questions and iterate on insights
- Automating repetitive or boilerplate EDA steps
- Maintaining human oversight and interpretation

##  Why It Matters

Prompt engineering is a practical skill for data scientists working in fast-paced environments where quick insights and ideation are valuable. This document reflects my growing experience in:

- Understanding the capabilities and limits of generative AI
- Communicating with LLMs to co-pilot analysis work
- Thinking critically about AI-generated output
